## A talk about Data Science by Roy Keyes and Steve Koch

These are the slides for a talk that gives a general overview of data science and briefer overview of "big data". The title is _Data Science, Big Data, and other buzzwords_.

This slide deck is a more generic version of a talk we gave at the ABQ Tech Fiesta 2013. We hope it will be useful for others creating talks on the topic. Please feel free to re-use and modify the talk and graphics under the terms listed in the License.txt document.
